# Brummi Adventure Jump and Run Game
This could be a beautiful cross platform game, telling kids not going out with strangers,
or explain kids what is ok and what not. The idea of the game is to get the attention of kids with a good gameplay and start dialogs with predators. Currently the game is in German but we are open for any language. Give predators no chance to abuse or rape kids with preventive work in this case. 

# Who is Brummi?
